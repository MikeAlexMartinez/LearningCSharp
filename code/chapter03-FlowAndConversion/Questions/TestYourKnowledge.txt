5. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value
beyond its range?
Depending on the context of how the variable is set a number of things can happen.

If unchecked value will roll around.

6. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y; ?

the latter increments y and then sets x to the value of y post-incrementation.

7. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside
