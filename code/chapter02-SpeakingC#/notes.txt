Chapter 2 Notes

To comment your code use '//'.
multi-line comments use /* */.

The end of a statement should finish with a semi-colon.

A statement can be made of multiple variables and expressions.

e.g.
  var fullname = firstName + lastName;

A block is created using curly braces {... }

A block can define a namespace, a class, a method or a statement.

C# vocabulary is made up of keywords, symbols and types.

Some are predefined reserved keywords:
e.g.
  using
  namespace
  class
  static
  int
  string
  double
  bool
  var
  if
  switch
  break
  while
  do
  for
  foreach
  ... and so on

There are 79 reserved keywords and 25 contextual keywords.
104 total.

Doing or action words are called methods.

the way a function or method runs depends on it's context and it's specifics,
i.e. what arguments it's called with. This is called overloading.

Nouns can e 'types', 'fields' or 'variables'.

e.g. Animal = type, Head = field, Coco = variable.

Strictly speaking C# provides no types. Keywords such as string that look
like types are aliases, that represent types provided by the platform.

In C# every type can be classified as a:
  class
  struct
  enum
  interface, or
  delegate
