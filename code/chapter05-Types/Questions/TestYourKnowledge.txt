1. What are the four access modifiers and what do they do?
public - accessible everywhere
private - only accessible in the class code
protected - accessible by instances of the class, can't be modified
protected virtual - accessible everywhere, cant be modified.

2. static, const, readonly
static - value available across all instances of a class.
const - value is set and can't change at runtime. during compilation
  all references to const are changed to actual value.
readonly - means property is only able to be read, not changed.

3. What does a contructor do?
It initializes an instance of an object, assigning defined properties
and returning an instance of the object.

4. Why do you need to apply the [Flags] attribute to an enum keyword
when you want to store combined values?
So that the compiler knows the enum can contain more than one value.

5. why is the parital keyword useful?
It allows you to create more modular class code, allowing multiple people
to work on a class simultaneously.

6. What is a tuple?
allows storage of multiple types of values in a single object / data structure.

7. What does the ref keyword do?
the ref keyword tells a method that a reference to a variable is being passed
so any method scoped changes to that variable will change the originally passed
variable in the outer scope also.

8. What does overloading mean?
Creating methods of the same name with differing signatures is overloading
the method. the signature used will define which method actually runs.

9. What is the difference between a field and property?
A field is a regular variable used within a class / method to store data.
a property is a data storing value on an object that may or may not be accessible
outside of that object.

10. How do you make a method parameter optional?
Apply a default value to the paramter and it becomes optional.
